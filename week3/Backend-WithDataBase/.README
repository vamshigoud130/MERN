MongoDB CRUD (Using Mongoose)
--------------------------------
In this approach, data is stored in a MongoDB database.
Mongoose is used as an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB.

Purpose:
- To understand database integration
- To define schemas and models
- To apply validation rules
- To perform persistent CRUD operations
- To simulate real-world backend applications

MongoDB Compass can be used to visually manage and verify the stored data.
