Week-3: CRUD APIs using Local Memory & MongoDB

This task focuses on building CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs using backend technologies.
The implementation is done using two different approaches to understand how data handling works with and
without a database.

1. Local Memory CRUD
-------------------
In this approach, data is stored in local memory using JavaScript arrays.
No database is used, and the data exists only while the server is running.

Purpose:
- To understand Express.js routing
- To learn HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- To practice handling request body and parameters
- To focus on backend logic without database dependency

Limitations:
- Data is temporary
- Data is lost when the server restarts
- Not suitable for production use
